# GitHub Awareness Campaign
This project is to show how the GitHub contribution graph is NOT an ideal tool to evaluate developers.

## Background
In the most popular code hosting solutions (i.e. GitHub and GitLab), there is a [visual graph that is presented on each user profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile) with a purpose to illustrate their activities. It's intended to measure how developers are active on daily basis.

The graph is very useful for personal activity tracking, nothing else —practically— from my humble experience. However, it still misleads many people (including talent acquisition managers in large companies as I witnessed) who depend on it for evaluation. Thus, [I](https://amstalks.com/) have created this project to demonstrate how developers can easily fill their graphs with meaningless autogenerated contributions using [the script](/script.py).

Unfortunately, there is no option to completely disable the graph on GitHub. Alternative solutions (like [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and its fork [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)) has decided not to present the graph on the mainpage of user profiles but on their dashboards which is more practical for its purpose.
